# Competitive Programming Sessions

This folder contains presentations and materials from our competitive programming sessions. These sessions are designed for enthusiasts (non-professionals) interested in learning and applying algorithms to solve problems.

The focus is on understanding key algorithms, improving problem-solving skills, and applying the techniques in a practical way.

Feel free to use the materials for your own learning or share them with others who are on the same journey.
